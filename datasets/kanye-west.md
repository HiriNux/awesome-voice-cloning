# Kanye West Dataset

This is actually going to be two datasets, one for plain speech, and one for acapellas, which I'm calling YeSpeech and SongYe, respectively. I'm not a big Kanye guy, so I'd really appreciate people pointing to resources for this one.  For plain speech we want to look primarily for podcasts, interviews, and audiobooks (If Ye's ever done one of those). For acapellas, I found some stuff on google, but other than that I've got nothing. If you can send links to audio or raw files that's great; if you can send already transcribed audio that's even better.

# YeSpeech

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuOCvKvrwI8 - Two hour interview, some low frequency environment noise. Kinda bassy, room sounds bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t568Nd7k_Yk - 45 minute interview, occasional reverb issues, less low end than I'd like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rn0hDB6Z8k - 45 Minute interview, low end is pretty strong, lots of background noise / clothing rumple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxwfDlhJIpw - Two hour long video, reverb and background sound issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixLOt-MeDyU - Hour long interview, sounds pretty good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A445TwDpFiY - 45 minute interview, pretty good

# SongYe

https://www.kanyetothe.com/forum/index.php?topic=4862457.0 (toward the bottom, 60+ acapellas, unknown quality. If anyone familiar with Kanye's discography can take a look at this and let me know the year range, that'd be cool too)
